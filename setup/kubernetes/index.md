description: Learn how to set up a Kubernetes cluster for your Coder deployment.
---

You can deploy Coder into any [compatible Kubernetes cluster]. We recommend
following the [Kubernetes upstream version support policy] in order to receive
applicable fixes, including security fixes, from the project maintainers.

[compatible kubernetes cluster]: ../requirements.md
[kubernetes upstream version support policy]:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/

This section contains guides for creating a compatible cluster on common
platforms, including Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and Amazon Web
Services. If you already have a Kubernetes cluster, you may wish to skip to the
[installation guide].
