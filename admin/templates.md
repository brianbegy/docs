  Learn how to add an embeddable "Open In Coder" button for your Workspaces As Code Template
---

The **Admin** > **Templates** tab offers a form for generating an embeddable button
to make it easy for developers to use your [workspace template](../environments/workspaces-as-code/index.md). The generated Markdown can be added to your
repository's `README.md`.
