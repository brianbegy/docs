Workspaces as Code (WAC) brings Infrastructure As Code to environment
configuration. Users can use this feature to manage environment config
in the same repo as their source code; simply add a `.coder/coder.yaml` to
get started.

## Open In Coder

In order to make it easy for your users to take advantage of your WAC config,
file you can add an "Open in Coder" badge to your repository's `README.md`.

To generate a badge for your repository, navigate to
**Manage** > **Admin** > **Templates**
