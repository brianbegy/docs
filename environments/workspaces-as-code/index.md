Workspaces as code (WAC) brings the _Infrastructure As Code_ paradigm to Coder
environments. WAC allows you to define and create new environments using
**workspace templates**.

[Workspace Templates](./templates.md) are declarative YAML files that describe
how to configure environments and their supporting infrastructure.

## Requirements

- You must configure a [GitHub or GitLab OAuth service](../../admin/git.md)
- The image you use in your template **must** have been
  [imported](../../images/importing.md) into Coder

## Creating a workspace template

You can find a fully populated workspace template and descriptions of each field
in our [syntax guide](templates.md).

## Adding an Embeddable Button

To make it easy for your developers to use your template you can generate an
embeddable Markdown button. See the [admin guide](../../admin/templates.md)
